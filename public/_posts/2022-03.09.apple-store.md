In the past 7 years, I had finally transitioned to Apple products, especially macOS. I finally purchased a MacBook Pro 13" 2015, a year before apple shipped butterfly keyboards. I was mainly using the MacBook as my daily driver along with Elementary OS, a Linux distribution and I was basically trying to avoid Windows.

As a full stack developer, I wanted a macOS environment to mainly work with web development and it was basically easier to deal with because Windows sucks at developments in my own experience. Then, I sold my Macbook Pro 13" 2015 and got a brand new MacBook Pro 2019. Yes, it had the butterfly keyboard and i hated so much that I traded in for a MacBook Pro 2020, the last version of Intel before M1. 

I eventually bought the MacBook Air M1 as well just to make sure that my daily routine as a full stack developer still works with M1 chip and it did. So eventually, I traded two MacBook Air/Pro, along with two iPhone Xr and got myself a brand new MacBook Pro 14" M1 Pro with 512GB and 16GB of RAM.
