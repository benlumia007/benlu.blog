In the past couple of weeks, I have been experimenting <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.com" target="_blank">Jigsaw Tighten</a>, a static site generator based on Laravel's Blade system and  I have find it very easy to learn since I have played around with Laravel before. I find one thing that was interesting is that Jigsaw Tighten uses Markdown for contents and it was something that I was looking for.

While I was working with Jigsaw, I wanted to do something different and didn't want the folders/files structure that many people use so I started to experiment with the `config.php` and this is what I came up with.
<pre>
return [
    'build' => [
        'source' => 'public'
    ],
];
</pre>
This config above tells Jigsaw to use the `public` folder instead of the `source` folder and for the `source/_assets`, I change it to `resources/assets` and this is what the end result looks like.
<pre>
app
public
   _layouts
   _posts
   404.md
   about.md
   contact.md
   index.md
resources
   js
      app.js
   scss
      screen.scss
bootstrap.php
composer.json
config.php
helpers.php
package.json
webpack.mix.js
</pre>
As you can see, I just like this structure because it is what I'm used to when working with any kind of PHP application. I also want to make a note that you can use `index.blade.md` if you need blade if you need it.
