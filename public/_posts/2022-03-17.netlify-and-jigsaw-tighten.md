My personal blog has been around for a while and I can't tell you how many times it's been converted throughout the years. It was originally started as a static HTML, <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.classicpress.net" target="_blank">ClassicPress</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and now <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.com" target="_blank">Jigsaw Tighten</a>. However, before Jigsaw Tighten, I was using Justin Tadlock's <a href="https://github.com/blush-dev" target="_blank">Blush</a> ( formerly Nova ) framework for a while but I decide to give Jigsaw tighten a try for my personal blog. I haven't give up on Blush yet since I'll be using that for another site that I am currently working on.

## Why the move?
To be honest, I don't really have a decent answer for that. I guess that I just wanted to try something different for a change and expand my development process for something entirely. This is where Netlify and Jigsaw Tighten comes into play.

<a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> is an all-in-one platform for automating web projects which replaces your hosting infrastructure and deploys with a single workflow and is free to use. I eventually signed up for Netlify awhile back but never continued but now I am currently using Netlify and finally setup my domain to be host on Netlify for free and see how will it will handle my site.
