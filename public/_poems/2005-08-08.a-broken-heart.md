He feels depression and sadness in his life
Unable to feel love and comfort of what he did
His sad heart was broken with all the pain in his life
He never knew laughter only strife

It wasn't his fault, it wasn't his fault
it was those around him that bought him to halt
Those who push him and shove him all day long
Made him do what he knew was wrong

He went home on a sad and lonely night
Not looking for sympathy, not looking for a fight
He sat there on his bed as he started to tear
With a mind of sadness and fear

His eyes began to fill with tears
As his heart begin to race
his mind begin to shudder
He could not bear to look at his face

He know what needed to do
To apologize for what he had done
Forgiveness is what he wanted
Hopefully he had learned his lession
