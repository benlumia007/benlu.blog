In the past few weeks, I was looking around for a new laptop and I was pretty set on getting the MacBok Pro 14" M1 Pro base model and I finally went and got one today. The base model contains 512GB and 16GB of RAM and it has been a blast so far after couple of hours of use so far and I'm currently writing this post on this neat little hardware.

I managed to trade in a few devices through the Apple Trade-in program and pretty much got the MacBook Pro 14" M1 Pro $600 with at east $1,500 trade in value. My previous MacBook Pro 13", the last version of Intel was pretty was decent but I guess that I just wanted the M1 Pro for personal reasons.

While I was getting all the software that I used for development, I think the only piece of software that uses Rosetta 2 is Discord and the rest were all natively built.
